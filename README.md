This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Idea

International students have no way to find out which companies sponsor them. MySponsor is where they can find "MySponsor". Taking input from __ international students who have signed up, users can see which companies sponsor international students and identify how other users acquired their internships.
